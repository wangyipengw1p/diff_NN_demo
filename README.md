# Diff core demo
> This is the active repository of the demo proj on zynq 7035 and will be updated continuously untill finish. However, I would make this repository private if I were requested by my instructor, prof. Dr. Yongpan Liu and Dr. Zhe Yuan.

This is a dedicated accelerator system construction for a [specific network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) for End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars, using the method propased by (Zhe Y., ISSCC 2020).

(I've just finished final exams) Currently, the core design is completed. The demo construction will complete in few days.

Sorry that the design document is in Chinese currently. But will be translated in the future.
